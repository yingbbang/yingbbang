### 🚀 Featured Projects

## 🪙 Boogi Busan Tour Challenge — Tour-to-Earn with BNK Stablecoin  
Discover Busan in a new way with **Boogi**, the city’s beloved mascot, and **BNK Busan Bank’s stablecoin ‘Shin Dongbaekjeon’**.  
This gamified tourism platform rewards users with **experience points (XP)** when they pay with Shin Dongbaekjeon and visit **certified landmarks by the Busan Tourism Organization**.  

As players collect XP and help Boogi grow, they naturally connect **travel, spending, and finance** into one integrated experience.  
This project goes beyond simple entertainment — it’s a **financial gamification initiative** that transforms Busan’s regional brand and financial platforms into **experience-based trust assets**.  

Each mission and payment deepens awareness and affection for **Shin Dongbaekjeon** and **Boogi**,  
allowing MZ users to enjoy, engage, and contribute to the local economy in a fun and meaningful way.  

> **Play, explore, and earn — experience Busan through Boogi and BNK Stable!**


## 💩💥[Boogie-hotteok-dodge]([https://github.com/yingbbang](https://github.com/yingbbang/boogie-hotteok-dodge/tree/main))
This is a hotteok-dodging game that features Dongbaekjeon, the local currency of Busan, and Boogi, the city’s official character.
The project aims to naturally connect local finance and digital assets through a gameplay style familiar to the MZ generation.

“Boogi Hotteok Dodge” is a digital content with the characteristics of an experience good.
Its value—such as enjoyment, difficulty, and immersion—cannot be fully assessed in advance through descriptions or images;
it can only be realized through direct gameplay experience.
Such experience-based consumption leads to user engagement, repeat play, and brand trust formation.

Therefore, this project is more than just a game —
it is a strategic attempt to transform Busan’s local brand and financial platform into experiential trust assets.
Playing the game itself becomes a medium of experience-driven marketing,
enhancing familiarity and affinity toward both the Dongbaekjeon currency and the Boogi brand.
